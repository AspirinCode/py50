# py50: Generate Dose-Response Curves

## Summary
The project was created to laboratory use. I found many of my classmates/coworkers were 
using a program that I found to be unfriendly to generate dose-response curves. I found
a few other repositories that can also generate dose-response curves in python, however,
they did not meet my requirements:
1. Can plug into a typical Jupyter Notebook or Python script
2. Adaptable to user needs
3. Easy to use (hopefully!)

This project meets our needs. And hopefully it can meet the needs of others.

## Installation
The package can be installed using the following:

```
pip install py50
```

## Tutorial
A Jupyter Notebook demoing the code can be found [here]().

A blog post demoing the code can be found at [Practice Coding]()

And finally, a documentation page set up through GitHub is currently in the works. 

## Citation
If you are interested in citing the file, I have generated a DOI link using Zenodo here:

## Future Work
I am interested in maintaining this for the foreseeable future. As such, I have several
things on my "To-Do" list. I will get around to them when I can. They are in no particular
order:

- Code for averaging and creating error bars on plot
- Code to generate EC50 plots
- Code to generate LD50 plots
- Housekeeping (I need to better understand Class composition!)

Thanks for your interest!
